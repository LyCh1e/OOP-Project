# Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It serves as a practical example for understanding and implementing core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.


# Features

Encapsulation: Implementation of classes with private fields and public methods to control data access.

Inheritance: Establishment of class hierarchies to promote code reusability.

Polymorphism: Utilization of method overriding and interface implementation to achieve dynamic behavior.

Abstraction: Definition of abstract classes and interfaces to model abstract concepts.


# Usage

After setting up the project, you can explore the various classes and their interactions to understand how OOP principles are applied. Run the main class to see the program in action.

# Getting Started
